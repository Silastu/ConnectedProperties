A connectible property is either _connected_ or _disconnected_.

When a property is connected to a carrier object, it has a value related to that object.

**Note:** A disconnected property is different than a connected property with a value of `null`.

Connected properties expose [an API](http://dotnetapis.com/pkg/Nito.ConnectedProperties/4.0.0-eta-01/netstandard1.1/doc/Nito.ConnectedProperties.ConnectedProperty) that allows the full range of connecting, disconnecting, getting, setting, and updating, all in a fully threadsafe fashion.
